# HacktoberFest2024-PP
My Planning is a simple web application for managing tasks (To-Do Lists). This project is a minimal dashboard to help users organise their day and manage their tasks more efficiently. 

 

## Basic functionalities :  

1. Task creation 

    Users can create a new task by providing a title and description. 

    Each task must have a default status (Not completed). 

 

2. Viewing tasks 

    The user can view the complete list of tasks created. 

    They can also view a specific task by its identifier. 

     

3. Updating tasks 

    The user can modify the information on an existing task (title, description, status). 

4. Deleting tasks 

    The user can delete a task from the list. 

     

5. Task status 

    Each task can be marked as Completed or Not Completed. 

    Completed tasks can be filtered or viewed separately. 

 

6. Filtering and searching 

    Users can filter tasks by status (Completed, Not completed). 

    They can also search for tasks by title or content in the description. 


## Additional features (suggestions for contributions) 

 

    Pagination: If the list of tasks becomes too long, add pagination to avoid data overload. 

    Auth: Set up authentication so that each user can manage their own tasks. 

    Priorities: Add a priority system for each task (low, medium, high). 

    Categories: Allow tasks to be classified by category (e.g. work, personal). 

    Notifications: Implement a notification system to warn the user when a task is close to its deadline. 

## Other proposals from contributors. 

 

## Basic project technology : 


-Frontend : NuxtJS (OpenSource) to code the Side client 

-Backend: NestJs (also OpenSource) to code the API 

-Database: Mongo DB (personnal cluster for this project) 

-Security: JWT 

This project uses MVC architecture
